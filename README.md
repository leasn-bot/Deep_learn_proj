## Description
Since we are not allowed to share the data we have trained on, you are not capable of running the notebooks without error. To see our work go through the notebooks WITHOUT running the code.  

The notebook `data_preprocessing.ipynb` contains the code for how we have preprocessed our data.

The other notebook `U_net_projectfile.ipynb` contains the U-net model, the training and testing.

Two example images are found in the folder `Test_images`. These can be run in the `Image_examples.ipynb` with the model file `model_final.pth` found under our submitted assignment.
